A website used to create and generate the game pieces used for games that run of the Profile System, the game system that powers games such as The Duke. Multiple pieces can be created and worked on at once and then downloaded as a set of pieces. Sets of pieces are stored in a JSON file that can later be imported back into the sit. Additionally, all of the current pieces can be rendered in a grid format, optimized for laser cutting.
