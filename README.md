### Intro

A website used to create and generate the game pieces used for games that run of the Profile System, the game system that powers games such as The Duke. Multiple pieces can be created and worked on at once and then downloaded as a set of pieces. Sets of pieces are stored in a JSON file that can later be imported back into the sit. Additionally, all of the current pieces can be rendered in a grid format, optimized for laser cutting.

### Workaround

Currently, the SVGs the are generated by the program won't import correctly into every program. To convert the SVGs into a more usable format, I discovered a workaround where you import them into Inkscape, then you export it as a PDF file. Then you open the PDF file using Inkscape and export the file back out as a SVG. The new SVG generated from this process will open correctly in all of the programs Ive encountered.

The files present in this project were created using resources that are available freely and openly by the creators of the games on their websites.
